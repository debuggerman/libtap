Very early start.

Usage:

    #include "tap.h", and link against libtap.so

Start by calling one of the plan_* functions:

    plan_no_plan()   /* you have no test plan, or */
    plan_skip_all()  /* all tests will be skipped, or */
    plan_tests(42);  /* you will run 42 tests */

Then you have one of ok() or ok2() at your disposal.  ok()'s first parameter
is the code to test.  The second parameter is the test name.  This is a 
printf()like format string, and the third and subsequent parameters should
fill out any values in the string.

    ok(a_func() == 0, "test name");
    ok(some_func(i), "some_func(%d)", i);

ok2() is for situations where the code to test is sufficiently 
self-documenting that you don't need to provide a test name.

    ok2(code to test); /* test name is automatically the same as the code */

E.g.,

    ok(1 == 1, "1 equals one"); /* PRINT: ok 1 - 1 equals 1 */
    ok2(1 == 2);                /* PRINT: ok 2 - 1 == 1 */

You also have diag(), which takes a printf() style format string and related
arguments, and sends the output to stderr as a test comment.  diag() adds
the necessary trailing "\n" for you.

    diag("Expected return code 0, got return code %d", rcode);

Finally, there's exit_status(), which returns an int suitable for use
when return'ing from main(), or calling exit().  You should always do one
of:

    return exit_status();
    exit(exit_status());

As appropriate.
